# Portfolio page

I wanted to work on a portfolio page but also work on new skills at the same time.

I'll expand on this ReadMe as I find more things to play with

Things I'm currently using:

-   Vite to install and setup react
-   Typescript, Since i've been doing so much with Javascript lately I wanted to expand on that skill set more
-   Shadcn UI. I wanted to worked with an unstyled component library to home my CSS skills more
-   TailwindCSS
-   Prettier so I can make sure things are formatted in a specific way I want.
-   SVG icons from https://icon-sets.iconify.design/bx/
-   Used Framer Motion to animate pages.
